1. An ATM card will allow you get cash at over 2,000 cash machines around Ireland. Most of our ATM’s will allow you to top up your mobile phone, check your balance and order statements to see how much money you have in your account. We’ll also pay the annual Government Stamp Duty on your ATM card (€2.50 per year) or your Debit card (up to €5 per year).

2. If you are aged 16 years old or over you are eligible to apply for a Visa Debit card. If you are under 18, we will need your parent or guardian to give us consent and indemnity before we process your application. With a Visa Debit card, you can shop and pay for your purchases directly from your 2nd level student current account, and it also saves you carrying cash around, so it’s perfect for school trips abroad. It’s quick, easy and a better way to pay.

You can use your Visa Debit card at home and abroad to withdraw cash from ATMs and pay for goods and services. However there may be charges for using your Visa Debit card abroad, so please check our Schedule of Fees & Charges brochure.

The money is taken directly out of your account. You can also top up using the free text number at anytime, anywhere in the world where your mobile operator has roaming.
